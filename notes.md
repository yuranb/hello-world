In this homework, I learned how to modify files and submit changes on GitHub, make changes to the same file in both local and remote repositories, and then attempt to merge these changes to synchronize the code.

In the Startup HTML homework, I learned the importance of structuring a web application with clear, semantic HTML. I understood how to create interconnected pages using links and organize content meaningfully within header, main, and footer sections. 

This CSS homework was instrumental in teaching me how to use styling to not just beautify a web application but also to improve its functionality and user experience. I learned that effective CSS styling goes beyond mere decoration and plays a critical role in web accessibility and usability.

In the server, database and websocket assignments, I learned the logic of the front and back end interact with each other, and know how to use websocket to realize the real-time chat function, but the most important thing is to determine the feasible solution before writing the code, I am in the websocket because I want to real-time update the weather data after the user's search results in a few hours of work found to be unfeasible (or too complicated) for me. is not feasible (or too complex).
So identifying a good idea is the key to accomplishing full-stack development in both the front and back ends.
